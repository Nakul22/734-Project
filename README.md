# Covid-19 Propagation
The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought the world to an almost complete halt in the first and second quarters of 2020. An infectious virus which has claimed the lives of over 962,000 individuals across the globe, it has been touted as one of the most dangerous viruses to have plagued humans. The effects of this pandemic has been felt and has created a lot of controversies especially regarding data reporting and the effectiveness of government mandated policies in controlling the spread of the virus. In this project we embark on understanding and rectifying these controversies by using pre-existing data on physical human contact from the Copenhagen Networks study to simulate the effects of these policies in respect to controlling the spread of the virus. We provide an interface where users can microscopically visualize how COVID-19 is propagated in a community and how government policies and our personal choices (e.g., social distancing, quarantining, etc.) affect the propagation of this virus.
